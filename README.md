# FuzzyGainSchedulingUAV
Simulation of Fuzzy Gain-Scheduling PID for UAV Position and Altitude Controllers using Matlab

FuzzyGainSchedulingUAV is a package with matlab simulations that allow user's to evaluate PID Gain-Scheduling for Position and altitude controllers using MATLAB. These simulations make usage of the asbQuadcopter in Matlab making easier for the reader to evalute these methods and reproduce these effects. 

For more detailed information please refer to the orginal paper in MDPI.
